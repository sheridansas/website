## Contributing

You may open pull requests, request to be added as a contributor by contacting an executive of SAS. When contributing, please follow:
1. **No vibe coding** - It ruins the entire point of this club, and tends to generate inefficient and/or insecure code.
2. **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself. This helps with maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

We are using now Tailwind for styling.

## TODO

- Get a better idea how we want to style this.
- Implement authentication.
- Implement admin.php to manage lessons, events, and resources.
